namespace dcr {

// Persistent fork/join worker pool used by MatrixProcessor to parallelize the
// per-channel plugin chains.  One published job at a time; workers grab work
// items via atomic fetch_add and the calling thread participates too so the
// caller's core isn't idle.
//
// Design notes:
//   - N persistent worker threads (chosen at construction).  They sleep on
//     std::atomic::wait when no job is published -- no busy-spin at idle.
//   - Each parallelFor() bumps jobGen, atomically publishes (fn, totalCount),
//     and notifies all workers.  Workers + the caller race to drain the
//     [0, totalCount) index range.
//   - The caller blocks on completedWorkers reaching numWorkers, again via
//     atomic::wait -- no spin.
//   - Lambda is captured into a std::function once per parallelFor().  Small
//     captures (e.g. just `this`) fit the std::function SBO so no heap
//     allocation in the hot path.
//
// Constraints:
//   - SINGLE producer.  Only the matrix thread is allowed to call
//     parallelFor().  Two concurrent submitters would corrupt the published
//     job state.
//   - Worker functions MUST be thread-safe vs. each other for their assigned
//     indices.  In MatrixProcessor's case each per-channel plugin chain has
//     its own buffer slice + its own slot lock -- no shared mutable state.
